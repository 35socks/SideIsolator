# SideIsolator

Ever wanna pick out elements in a song that aren't mono? This is the perfect tool.
----
# Setup:

Download the ```main.py``` file from the repository and place it in a folder (optional, just for organisation...)

Make sure you have the following modules installed:
<br>
```tkinter``` <br>
```scipy``` <br>
```numpy``` <br>

If you don't have all of these, just run the command:
```pip install``` with the module name :)
----
# Usage:

1. Run the ```main.py``` script.
2. A GUI should open and let you select a WAV file.
(This HAS to be a **STEREO WAV FILE ONLY**.)
3. Run the tool once selected file.
4. You should get a message box that says it's done and there will now be a new folder with the ```main.py``` file called "INVERSIONS" and within there will be a folder with your inversions inside!
